## Check-in 1 (Week 2)

IoT device management:
- High-level purpose: The DSL can be used by people to help plan their smart home device automations and integrations. It will generate a simulation of the smart home, in which the user can trigger events and see their automations occur in action.
- Rich features:
  1. Define types of devices, complete with a set of states a device of the defined type can have, as well as its initial state. Type hierarchy is possible.
  2. Build a mockup of the smart home. The user can define a room containing a set of devices which are of a certain type.
  3. Define actions that will be triggered upon the change of the specified deviceâ€™s state. The action can contain if-conditions and loops.
- Example (updated for Check-in 3):
  ```
  type Light {
      enum power [ON, OFF]
      string color 
  }
  
  type SmallLight inherits Light {
      enum power [DIMMED]
  }
  
  type Switch {
      enum state [ON, OFF]
  }
  
  type Heater {
      enum power [ON, OFF]
      number level [0, 10]
  }
  
  
  room bedroom {
      device bedroom_light of Light(OFF, "ffffff")
      device bedroom_lamp of SmallLight(OFF, "ffebd9")
      device bedroom_heater of Heater(OFF, 3)
      device bedroom_switch of Switch(OFF)
  }
  
  room living_room {
      device main_light of Light(OFF, "ffffff")
      device main_switch of Switch(OFF)
      device main_heater of Heater(OFF, 3)
  }

  
  action bedroom_all on bedroom_switch {
      if bedroom_switch.state is ON {
          set bedroom_light.power to ON
          set bedroom_lamp.power to DIMMED
          set bedroom_heater.power to ON
      }
  }
  
  action lights_all on main_switch {
      if main_switch.power is OFF {
          set main_light.power to OFF
          for light of Light in bedroom {
              set light.power to OFF
          }
      }
  }
  
  action sync_heaters on main_heater {
      set bedroom_heater.level to main_heater.level
  }
  ```

## Check-in 2 (Week 3)

### Jan 21 - 27
Jan 26 - Check-in 2 
- All:
  - Assign responsibilities for everyone.
  - Create a complete example of the DSL, with all finalized language features.
  - (Above are complete - progress so far.)
### Jan 28 - Feb 3
Feb 2 - Check-in 3
- All: 
  - Define grammar rules of the DSL.
  - Define the structure of the AST.
  - Plan and finish the first user study.
- Get started on the implementation.
  - Parser: String containing DSL --> AST
    - Richard
    - Jeffery
  - Evaluator: AST --> working console application
    - Ning
    - Terry
    - Leo
- Tests for components will be written by whoever wrote the component itself, as they will be the most familiar with
  what the tests should be about.
- With an agreed-upon definition of the AST, tests for the parser and evaluator components can be written independently
  and the implementation can be done in parallel.
- Invariants:
  - Initial states must be defined for all devices, including inherited attributes.
  - Subtypes must not be able to change definitions of inherited attributes. For enum attributes, a redefinition may be
    done to specify additional states.
  - Cannot refer to devices/rooms/types that hasn't been instantiated.
### Feb 4 - Feb 10
Feb 9 - Check-in 4
- All: Plan for the second user study.
- Finish bulk of the implementation. Revise language design/tests/implementation based on results of the first user study.
### Feb 11 - Feb 17
Feb 16 - Check-in 5
- All: Make a draft for the video.
- Possibly make final changes to language design/tests/implementation based on the second user study.
### Feb 18 - Feb 24
- All: Make the demo video.
### Feb 25 - Feb 26
Feb 26 - Due date
